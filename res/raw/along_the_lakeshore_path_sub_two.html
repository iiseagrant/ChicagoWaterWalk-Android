<title>Along the Lakeshore Path - Prescription for pollution</title>
</head>

<body>

Chances are prescription and over-the-counter  pharmaceuticals sitting in people's medicine cabinets right now will someday  find their way into water supplies. Most will get there when we excrete them or  unused pills are flushed down the toilet. Others will seep into groundwater from  meds tossed in landfills. These chemicals have been found in hundreds of rivers  and lakes across the country, including each of the Great Lakes, and in the  drinking water of 46 million Americans. Along the Chicago lakefront, scientists  have found everything from antibiotics to pain relievers to caffeine. The  levels detected aren't high enough to threaten human health, especially in the  short term. But they have already had impacts on fish and other wildlife. <br /><br />
  You can help by taking unwanted medicines to <a href="http://web.extension.illinois.edu/unusedmeds/disposal/">collection programs</a>. Your pills will be incinerated, which poses less threat to the  environment. Since 2003, Chicago and nearby suburbs have been hosting one-day  collection events. Permanent drop-off sites at five police stations across the  city also make it possible for residents to rid their medicine cabinets of  unwanted pharmaceuticals anytime. The city's permanent program alone keeps  thousands of pounds of medication out of Lake Michigan and area rivers each  year.
