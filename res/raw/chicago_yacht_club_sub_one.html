<title>The Chicago Yacht Club - The sea wall</title>
</head>

To shield their shores from waves that can cause flooding  and <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1142.html">erosion</a>, cities throughout the Great Lakes region have replaced natural  nearshore habitats with seawalls, breakwaters, and other "hard" structures. This  seawall helps protect nearby recreational and economic centers like Grant Park  and Michigan Avenue against everything from changing water levels to heavy  summer storms to the natural ebb and flow of Lake Michigan. <br /><br />
  Hard shorelines have their own problems, though. Sea walls  change the natural movement of water and sand. They can't absorb wave energy.  Instead, they push it back towards the lake, creating harsh waves that crash  against land beyond the protection of the sea wall and rapidly erode that  shoreline. Sand also builds up against the artificial structure, choking off  habitats there while starving beaches down shore. This is exactly what is  happening along Chicago's North Shore. Sea walls and other artificial  structures built near the northernmost suburbs have deprived other southern beaches  and nearshore habitats of sand and sped up erosion. The sea walls lining  Illinois' shore may shield some land from flooding and erosion, but the  shoreline as a whole is actually experiencing more of both as a result.
