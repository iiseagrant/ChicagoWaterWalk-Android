<title>The Michigan Avenue Bridge - Canal connections</title>
</head>

<body>

Despite what its name suggests, the Chicago River is  actually a system of rivers and canals designed to open up commercial shipping  between the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes. In the years before railroads  came to the Midwest, canals helped transform Chicago into a national shipping  and transportation hub. The first was the <a href="iisg://content/8">Illinois and Michigan Canal</a>.  When it was completed in 1848, the channel ran 96 miles to connect the Chicago  and Mississippi rivers for the first time. Â <br /><br />

  The city later <a href="iisg://content/6">built a second waterway</a>,  this time with the goal of reversing the flow of the Chicago River away from  Lake Michigan. After it was finished in 1900, commercial shipping relocated to  the new <a href="iisg://content/1">Chicago Sanitary  and Ship Canal</a>. Its wider banks and shorter length made it easier for boats  to navigate and made the Illinois and Michigan Canal unnecessary. The Chicago  Sanitary and Ship Canal is now the only link between the Great Lakes and the  Gulf of Mexico. Its 28 miles is controlled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  to prevent the spread of invasive species into the Great Lakes and ensure that  the amount of water the canal pulls from Lake Michigan stays below federal  limits.
