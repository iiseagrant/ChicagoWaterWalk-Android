<title>The Viewing Deck - The tale of shipwrecks</title>

At its height in the mid-1800s, <a href="iisg://content/2">Chicago Harbor</a> and its  surrounding waters was the most dangerous place in the Great Lakes. More  sailors and vessel passengers lost their lives along Chicago's shoreline than  anywhere else in the region. Here, boats were exposed to the fury of northern  winds and violent waves driven across the full 300 miles of the lake. But it  wasn't the weather alone that made Chicago so treacherous. As one of the  busiest ports in the world, Chicago Harbor drew thousands of schooners, canal  boats, and steam engines to the City of Broad Shoulders each year. The high  traffic made it difficult to navigate the harbor in even the best conditions.  Chicago's <a href="http://www.chicagomaritimemuseum.org/categories/shipwrecks/">shipping history</a> is filled with stories of vessels that crashed into  breakwaters, were torn to splinters by crashing waves, or collided with other  boats. <br /><br />
  On a windy morning in May of 1894, Chicago residents awoke  to newspaper headlines telling the shocking stories of some of these wrecks. A  massive storm the day before had wrecked eight schooners, more than any other  day in Chicago history. Among the wrecks was the ill-fated Myrtle. The little two-masted schooner had been riding out the  storm near the Chicago Harbor when another boat slammed into her. As Myrtle took on water, the storm pushed  her south along the lakefront. Several rescue boats were sent out to rescue Myrtle's six-man crew, but the dangerous  water forced them back to shore. One of these, a boat operated by the Chicago  Lifesaving Station, was overturned, leaving its would-be rescuers also in need  of saving. Stranded beyond the reach of help, the crew of the Myrtle was washed overboard and drowned.  She finally sunk off of 35th street, about 5 miles south of here.
