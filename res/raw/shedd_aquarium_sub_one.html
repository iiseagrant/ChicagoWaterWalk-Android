<title>Shedd Aquarium - A rocky home life</title>
</head>

<body>

What you see here is one of several rocky areas along the  Chicago shoreline that many fish species rely on to thrive. Some of these  artificial structures were built to replace lost habitats, especially for fish critical  to the overall health of the lake. Others are designed to attract popular  fishing species. The most notable is an <a href="http://wwx.inhs.illinois.edu/fieldstations/lmbs/reef/">artificial reef</a> located about 7 miles south of here and a mile  offshore. Since it was built in 1999, anglers and divers have seen smallmouth bass,  yellow perch, alewife, and other key species living among the granite rubble. <br /><br />
  The success of these habitats—whether natural or  artificial—lies in their complexity. Rock reefs, fallen logs, aquatic plants,  and other structures provide places for fish to hide from predators, escape the  hot summer sun, and safely lay their eggs. These structures are also colonized  by algae, bacteria, and insects, which other aquatic wildlife rely on for food.  Without these nearshore habitats, Lake Michigan would not be able to sustain the  large population of young and smaller fish that feed larger fish, birds, and  even humans.
