<a href="http://www.navypier.com/about/history.html">Navy Pier</a> got its name from its role as a base and training  center during both World Wars. During WWII, approximately 60,000 pilots and  sailors trained here, including President George H.W. Bush. After the war, the  pier served as a satellite campus for the University of Illinois before falling  into disuse in the 1960s. The crowds eventually returned in 1990 after major  renovations converted it to the tourist attraction it is today.

Those are  the walls of the Chicago Harbor Lock, the gateway to the city and one of the  engineering feats that helps the river maintain its unnatural flow towards the  Mississippi.
