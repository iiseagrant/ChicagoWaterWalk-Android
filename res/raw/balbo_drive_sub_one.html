Trees and native plants like the ones in Grant Park are  common tools in <a href="http://water.epa.gov/infrastructure/greeninfrastructure/">green infrastructure</a> planning, a way to manage stormwater by  replacing cement and asphalt with natural landscapes. Going green is cheaper  than using sewers, overflow pipes, and other traditional methods. Plants can  trap rainwater and prevent pollutants from city streets from running into  waterways. At the same time, green spaces provide food and homes for wildlife,  improve soil health, prevent erosion, replenish groundwater supplies, and  create beautiful, walkable areas for residents and tourists to enjoy.<br /><br />
  Some cities are using green infrastructure to <a href="http://www.chicagoclimateaction.org/pages/adaptation/49.php">prepare</a> for  the <a href="http://www.chicagoclimateaction.org/pages/climate_change_and_chicago/5.php">effects of climate change</a>. Scientists predict the Midwest will have wetter  winters and more frequent extreme events like blizzards, heavy rainstorms, and droughts.  Trees and other greenery along city streets can absorb and retain water, which  helps cities avoid the worst of droughts and storms and ensures residents have  access to a safe, stable supply of water. In Chicago, green infrastructure can  also help fight rising temperatures made worse by air pollution and buildings  and roads that trap heat. Trees cool the air and provide much needed shade.
