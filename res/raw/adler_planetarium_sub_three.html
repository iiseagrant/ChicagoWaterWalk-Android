Throughout the Great Lakes, an extensive system of  environmental tracking stations, buoys, and research vessels help scientists  and government officials keep an eye on the region. These tools are constantly  collecting and transmitting data like air and water temperature, wind speeds,  wave height and direction, and atmospheric pressure. The <a href="http://www.iisgcp.org/buoy/index.html">information</a> is used to  warn the public of hazardous conditions, protect water quality, and improve  weather forecasts. <br /><br />
  For example, experts use data on wave height and frequency to  predict where strong waves and rip currents are likely to create dangerous  swimming conditions. Keeping track of rainfall, currents, and water clarity  helps city officials determine when high bacteria levels make swimming unsafe.  And since most of the local data is <a href="http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=cnii2">available to the public</a>, boaters and  beach-goers can use it to plan trips to the lake. Anglers can even use  information on water temperature to know where to find specific species of  fish.
