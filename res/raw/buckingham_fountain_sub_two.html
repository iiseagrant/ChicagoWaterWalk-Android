<title>Buckingham Fountain - Using water wisely</title>

To make sure they are never left high and dry, officials in  northeast Illinois are ramping up water conservation efforts. At the top of the  list is the <a href="http://www.iisgcp.org/water_supply/water_rates.html">price of water</a>. Water bills often don't cover all the costs of  pumping, cleaning, and delivering water to homes and businesses. These lower  prices leave cities without money to repair aging pipes, many more than 100  years old. To pay for needed repairs and encourage people to conserve water,  experts recommend that communities charge what it really costs to supply water. <br /><br />
  Many communities in the region have also passed laws  restricting where and when residents can water their lawns. About one-third of all  drinking water is used on lawns. Illinois lawns need only an inch of water a  week, or about two hours of sprinkling. Extra water runs off and ends up in  nearby lakes or rivers, carrying chemicals and debris with it. Homeowners can  also <a href="http://www.iisgcp.org/water_supply/outdoor_conserv.html">reduce their water use</a> by running sprinklers in the morning, when water  won't evaporate as quickly, and letting lawns go dormant in times of  drought.
