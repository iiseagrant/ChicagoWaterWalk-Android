<title>The Chicago Yacht Club - Did you know?</title>
</head>

<body>

This clubhouse and pier is one of two operated by the  Chicago Yacht Club, best known for hosting the annual <a href="http://www.chicagomaritimemuseum.org/archives/chicago-to-mackinac-race/">Chicago to Mackinac Race</a>.  Clubhouses like these have been a part of the city's lakefront since 1900. <br /><br />
  The walkway you are following is actually the top of a  common coastal structure known as a sea wall. Sea walls serve as a kind of  armor for the shoreline, protecting it from erosion and flooding, and make it  easier for boaters, anglers, and others to enjoy the lake. These artificial  structures also change how the lake and the animals that call it home  function.
