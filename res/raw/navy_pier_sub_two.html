<title>Along the Pier - But when it rains...</title>
</head>

Even though the Chicago River now flows towards the  Mississippi, billions of gallons of polluted water still spill backwards into  the lake each year. The culprit is <a href="http://water.epa.gov/action/weatherchannel/stormwater.cfm">stormwater</a> that flows off rooftops, parking  lots, roads, and sidewalks and into sewer overflow pipes that empty into the  river. Less than an inch of rain is all that is needed to flood the city's sewer system and force water into the river. During big storms, the river can  become so swollen with stormwater that officials have to open the Chicago Harbor  Lock and let water flush into the lake to prevent the city from flooding. <br /><br />
  It is not just water that fills the river and pours into the  lake when it rains. Stormwater brings with it a toxic blend of pollutants from  city streets and <a href="http://www.iisgcp.org/l2l/index.html">lawns</a>—everything from gasoline and trash to fertilizers and  pesticides. In fact, stormwater is one of the biggest sources of water  pollution. These contaminants degrade water quality, raise water temperatures,  and suffocate fish eggs and newly hatched larvae. Bacteria carried in rainwater can also make swimming in the lake dangerous. In fact, stormwater is behind most of the swimming advisories and beach closures that plague the Great Lakes  region each summer.  <br /><br />
Concerns about stormwater pollution are on the rise as <a href="http://www.chicagoclimateaction.org/pages/precipitation/21.php">heavy rains</a> are becoming more common. Between 2007 and 2010, a new high of 19 billion  gallons of contaminated water was released into Lake Michigan. The spike was largely  because of two downpours in 2008 and 2010, some of the worst in Chicago  history.
