<title>Along the Lakeshore Path - The ABCs of PCBs, mercury</title>
</head>

<body>

Many industrial chemicals that bombarded the lake and nearby  rivers during most of the 20th century, such as PCBs and mercury, have since  been banned or heavily regulated. Still, they live on in sediment and in fish  and other organisms. The toxins are at their highest in the tissue of predatory  fish like salmon and trout because they ingest more chemicals each time they  eat contaminated fish. In fact, PCBs and mercury levels in adult predatory fish  can be thousands of times higher than the levels found in sediment—high enough  for states to set limits on what is safe to eat. These <a href="http://fn.cfs.purdue.edu/fish4health/">advisories</a> help anglers  and consumers avoid eating toxins that have been linked to serious human health  concerns like cancer and birth defects.  <br /><br />
  High contaminant levels can also drive away aquatic life and  waterbirds altogether and leave the water unsafe for people to drink or swim  in. To restore areas hit hardest by pollution, the federal government passed  the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/glla/">Great Lakes Legacy Act</a>, which provides funding for communities to clean up  river and lake bottoms. As of 2013, 15 sites across the region have been  cleaned up, and almost 2.4 million cubic yards of polluted sediment have been  removed or capped.
