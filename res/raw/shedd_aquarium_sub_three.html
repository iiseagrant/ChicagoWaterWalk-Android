<title>Shedd Aquarium - Then add aquatic invaders</title>
</head>

<body>

For centuries, humans have been moving plants and animals to  new homesâ€”sometimes accidently, sometimes not. In their new environment, some  non-native species can force out native ones and wreak havoc on ecosystems and  economies. The Great Lakes is now home to roughly 200 non-native fish,  invertebrates, plants, and microscopic organisms. Some of these, like zebra  mussel and round goby, have permanently impacted the health of the lakes. And  many more <a href="http://www.iisgcp.org/topic_ais.html">aquatic invasive species</a> (AIS) like these lurk on the horizon. <br /><br />
  At the heart of AIS concerns is the impact they have on food  webs. Without natural predators to keep them in check, invasive species can  quickly outnumber and outeat native species. In Lake Michigan, the spiny water  flea has actually wiped out entire species of plankton, the backbone of aquatic  food webs, and left behind too little food for native crustaceans and some fish  to survive. <a href="http://www.chicagobotanic.org/research/conservation/invasive/whatis.php">Invasive aquatic plants</a> can also choke off waterways, forming dense  mats that block out sunlight needed by other species. This also makes boating  and swimming difficult. <br /><br />
  It is nearly impossible to get rid of invasive species after  they have been introduced to a new area. The key is prevention, and there is a  lot that people can do to <a href="http://www.iisgcp.org/ais/transportzero.html">help stop the spread</a>. Next time you go fishing,  boating, or even swimming in a lake or river, make sure you remove any plants  or animals on your equipment and wash and dry everything before you leave. Plant  non-invasive species in your water gardens and aquariums. And be careful that  you don't dump plants, fish, or animals into any water body.
