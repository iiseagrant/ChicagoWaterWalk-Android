<title>The Chicago River Mouth - And the locks are key</title>
</head>

<body>

The Chicago Harbor Lock just east of the river mouth is used to  control the depth and speed of the river. With two metal gates that can shut  off or turn on the flow of water, the lock was built to ensure that the  river doesn't draw more water from the lake than federal law allows.  Controlling how much water is in the river also helps keep it flowing away from  Lake Michigan. Water levels in the Chicago River are kept around 1-4 feet below  the lake. Without the lock, stormwater flooding into the river or unusually low  lake levels could leave the river higher than the lake. If that were to happen,  gravity would start to pull water back toward Lake Michigan.   <br /><br />
  The river does at times spill backwards into the lake. It can become so swollen with stormwater that the lock has to  be opened to prevent flooding, returning the river to its original  flow for roughly a day. <br /><br />
  The dual gate system also makes it possible for boats  to safely move between the differing depths. An estimated  50,000 vessels move through the lock each year, with ships and barges carrying  approximately 200,000 tons of cargo.
