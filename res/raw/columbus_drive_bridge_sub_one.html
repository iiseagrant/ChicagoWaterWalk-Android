<title>The Columbus Drive Bridge - Big rains are a big deal</title>
</head>

<body>

At the turn of the 20th century, the flow of the <a href="iisg://content/1">river was reversed</a> to protect  Lake Michigan, the city's primary source of drinking water, by sending  Chicago's waste to the Mississippi River. Despite this <a href="iisg://content/6">engineering feat</a>,  billions of gallons of untreated sewage, industrial pollution, and <a href="http://water.epa.gov/action/weatherchannel/stormwater.cfm">stormwater</a> flow  from the river into the lake every year. Less than an inch of rain is all it  takes to push polluted water out of city and suburban sewers and into the  river. To prevent flooding in the city during the biggest storms, officials are  forced to open the locks that separate the river from Lake Michigan. When the  locks are opened, the Chicago River resumes its original course, and its contaminated  waters are flushed directly into the lake.Â  <br /><br />

  Between 2007 and 2010, the city's sanitary district released  nearly 19 billion gallons into the lake, in part due to two monsoon-like storms  in 2008 and 2010, among the worst in Chicago history.
