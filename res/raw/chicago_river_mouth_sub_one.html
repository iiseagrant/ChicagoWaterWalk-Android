<title>The Chicago River Mouth - The river runs backwards</title>
</head>

<body>

For most of its history, the Chicago River sluggishly moved water  from the plains to Lake Michigan. When raw sewage and other pollutants were  dumped in the river, they flowed into Chicago's primary source of drinking water.  As the city grew, fear of disease spread, and officials decided to permanently <a href="iisg://content/1">reverse the river's flow</a>,  sending its polluted water to the Mississippi River instead.<br /><br />
  A 28-mile-long canal was built between the Chicago River and  the rivers that drain into the Mississippi. The canal was designed to get  deeper as it moves west, allowing it to drain water from the shallower Chicago  River. When a steam shovel removed the last of the dirt separating the river  from the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal on a cold January morning in 1900, the  river emptied into the canal and began pulling water from the lake.    <br /><br />
  The eight-year project was named one of the seven wonders of  engineering by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1955. In 1999, the  society called the Chicago River system a "Civil Engineering Monument of the  Millennium."
