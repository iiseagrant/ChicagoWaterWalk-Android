You may have noticed a curious red-and-white structure just  visible in the distance. This is the Harrison-Denver Intake Crib, better known  as Two-Mile Crib. It is the water's first stop on its journey from Lake  Michigan to the faucets of millions of Chicago residents and businesses. This  crib was completed in 1935, but the city has relied on <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/300035.html">structures like this</a> for  safe drinking water for roughly 150 years. Today, Chicago has four active water  intake cribs that together deliver more than a billion gallons of water a day  for millions of thirsty people in Chicago and some neighboring communities. <br /><br />

  Closer to shore—and much easier to see—is another building  that helped the Windy City become what it is today: the <a href="http://www.chicagomaritimemuseum.org/archives/historical-chicago-lighthouses/">Chicago Harbor Lighthouse</a>. This lighthouse has guided water traffic into the Chicago River for  over a century. And its predecessor did the same for more than 50 years before.  Together, they helped the <a href="iisg://content/2">Chicago  Harbor</a> become the most important in the region and turned the city into one  of the world's busiest ports.
