<title>Adler Planetarium - ...Disrupt the lake</title>

A couple  more inches of rain a year or a few degrees warmer may not seem like a big deal.  But these weather changes, already underway in the Midwest, could be devastating  for the health of Lake Michigan. When city sewers overflow, rainwater runs into  the Chicago River and the lake, carrying pollutants with it. As <a href="http://www.chicagoclimateaction.org/pages/precipitation/21.php">heavy rainstorms</a> become more frequent, more gasoline, trash, fertilizers, pesticides,  and other contaminants will degrade Chicago's water quality and harm fish and  other aquatic wildlife. And the force of the stormwater flowing into the lake  or river can erode shorelines and disrupt fish spawning, development, and  migration.

Warmer-than-normal  lake temperatures could also wreak havoc on the food web. Higher water  temperatures block nutrients from spreading throughout the lake, making it hard  for organisms at the bottom of the food chain to find food. As a result,  everything from tiny crustaceans to large predatory fish are left with less to  eat. And because warmer water has less oxygen, rising temperatures could leave  fish without the oxygen they need to grow and reproduce. Long-term increases in  water temperature can even cause a massive die-off of fish.

Unusually  high temperatures, especially during winter months, also contribute to Lake  Michigan's record-low water levels. Large sheets of ice that cover the lakes in  winter and slow down evaporation are becoming a thing of the past. Large  portions of the lake have been ice-free for years, causing more water to evaporate  than spring and summer rainfall can replace.
