<title>Monroe Harbor - The lakefront 2.0</title>
</head>

<body>

The first European settlers found the shoreline near where  Michigan Avenue is now. Expansion into the lake began in the late 1800s, when  debris from the <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1740.html">Great Chicago Fire</a> was used to create land that eventually grew  to become <a href="iisg://content/3">Grant Park</a>,  just west of here. Over roughly 50 years, eastern Chicago grew by about 2,000  acres with the help of landfill, ash, and dirt. Much of this work, including  the expansion of Grant Park, was inspired by the famous 1909 <i><a href="http://chicagocarto.com/burnham/lakefront.html">Plan of Chicago</a></i>, which  introduced ideas for converting the lakefront into public land. <br /><br />
  The city has historically struggled to control erosion along  its entirely man-made shoreline. Changing water levels and winter storms have  chipped away at beaches, filled in navigation channels and harbors, and damaged  breakwaters and other structures designed to prevent coastal erosion. Ironically,  these structures have sped up erosion in places by moving sand and exposing  finer lakebed sediments to waves they cannot withstand. The battle with erosion  has led to several redevelopment projects over the decades, including one in  1996 when more landfill was added near here to create a larger buffer between  Lake Shore Drive and the lake.
