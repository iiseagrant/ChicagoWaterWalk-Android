Most of the land around you is part of <a href="http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks/grant-park/">Grant Park</a>. Known as  "Chicago's front yard," the <a href="iisg://content/3">park was built</a> to create  public space along the lakefront and to act as a buffer between the busy  downtown and the lake. In addition to flower gardens, open lawns, and trees, the  park has plots of native prairie grasses and wildflowers that can absorb water  and filter out pollutants. Grant Park is the site of popular food and music festivals and the home of numerous sculptures and large art installations. Walk  to the northwestern corner of the park and you will be standing on the largest  green roof in the worldâ€”covering 24.5 acres of rail yards and parking lots  below. The area was renovated in 1998 and dubbed Millennium Park.
