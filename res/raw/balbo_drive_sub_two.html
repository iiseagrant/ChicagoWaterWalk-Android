<title>Balbo Drive - For when it rains...</title>

Downtown Chicago is a series of rooftops, parking lots,  roads, sidewalks, and other surfaces that cannot absorb water. When it rains, water  flows across these hard surfaces and pours into the Chicago River, Lake  Michigan, or city sewers that empty into both during heavy storms. <br /><br />
  <a href="http://water.epa.gov/action/weatherchannel/stormwater.cfm">Stormwater runoff</a> is one of the biggest culprits in lake and  river pollution. When it flows into nearby waterways, runoff brings everything with  itâ€”from gasoline and trash on city streets to fertilizers and pesticides from  lawns. These pollutants degrade water quality, raise water temperatures, and  spur algae growth. As you might imagine, pollutants are also bad for fish. They  clog gills, decrease resistance to disease, and suffocate eggs and newly  hatched larvae. Bacteria carried in runoff can also make swimming in the lake a  health risk. Stormwater runoff is behind most of the swim advisories and beach  closures that plague the Great Lakes region each summer. <br /><br />
  Concerns about stormwater pollution are on the rise as  storms get bigger. During 2007-2010, the city's sanitation district was forced  to release 19 billion gallons of contaminated water into Lake Michigan, largely  because of two monsoon-like storms that flooded the city in 2008 and 2010.
