<title>Northerly Island - The Garden City</title>
</head>

<body>

Northerly Island is not the only "green" work underway in  Chicagoâ€”not even close. The city has also invested in projects to reduce high  temperatures, flooding, and water contamination caused by buildings and roads  that absorb heat but not stormwater. You may have already heard about the  <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dgs/supp_info/city_hall_green_roof.html">garden</a> planted on top of City Hall, but that is just one of many in the area.  In fact, the city has planted or helped plant more than 2 million square feet  of rooftop gardens, more than any other U.S. city. On the ground, concrete and  asphalt alleys are being replaced with pavement that can absorb water. The <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot/provdrs/street/svcs/green_alleys.html">Green Alley Program</a> has also installed drainage systems that funnel water away from  sewers and into the ground to be absorbed by plants and trees. Throughout the  city, parks have been expanded and roughly 500,000 more trees have been  planted. And residents are learning how to capture and reuse rainwater, find  native plants, and fertilize their soil with compost thanks to the <a href="http://www.sustainablebackyards.org/">Chicago Sustainable Backyards Program</a>. <br /><br />
  The Chicago area has also undergone hundreds of restoration  projects in the last few decades. These projects have rebuilt wetlands,  returned farm fields to native prairie grassland, removed old and worn out dams  that disrupt the natural flow of rivers, built rock reefs for fish and other  aquatic wildlife, reconnected habitats divided by urbanization, and cleaned up  pollution from the <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/638.html">region's industrial past</a>.
