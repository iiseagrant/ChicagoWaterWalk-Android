<title>The Ohio Street Beach - Did you know?</title>
</head>

<body>

The <a href="http://www.cpdbeaches.com/beaches/ohio-street-beach/">Ohio Street Beach</a> is one of 24 lining Chicago's shore. Although a much smaller man-made  beach sat near here in the early 1900s, the beach you see now formed naturally  after the Jardine Water Purification Plant was built in the 1960s. The plant,  which juts out into Lake Michigan just south of here, stops sand from moving along  the lakefront. Because it is the only one in the city facing north, Ohio Street  Beach is an ideal training site for open water swimming. You could swim in deep  water from here to Oak Street Beach half a mile north without ever being more  than a few feet from the safety of shallow water. <br /><br />
On a summer day,  odds are good that the beach is open and a lot of people are enjoying a day at  the lake. Strong currents or high bacteria levels, though, sometimes make the  water unsafe, prompting the Chicago Park District to issue <a href="http://www.cpdbeaches.com/">swimming advisories</a> or close the beach altogether. But thanks to a network of environmental sensing  buoys, these warnings and closures are more up-to-date and accurate today than  they have ever been.
