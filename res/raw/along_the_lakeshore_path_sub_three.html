<title>Along the Lakeshore Path - From your lawn to the lake</title>
</head>

If you are a homeowner, landscaper, or gardener, you are  probably familiar with the routine of applying fertilizers and pesticides. What  you may not know, though, is that much of the soil in the Midwest already has  all the nutrients plants need to grow and defend themselves against pests. In  fact, fertilizers with phosphorus are illegal in Illinois because the soil  already has enough. Adding too much lawn product can actually weaken plants,  promote diseases, and invite more pests. The chemicals can also be washed into  nearby lakes and rivers in <a href="http://water.epa.gov/action/weatherchannel/stormwater.cfm">stormwater</a>. <br /><br />
  Pesticides—like the ones used in common "weed and feed"  products that combine fertilizers and herbicides—can be especially harmful to aquatic  environments. Fish and other aquatic wildlife exposed to these chemicals are  more vulnerable to disease and lay fewer eggs. In higher doses, pesticides are  lethal. Across the country, millions of fish, frogs, turtles, mussels, and  water birds die from pesticide poisoning each year.   <br /><br />
  Landscapers and gardeners can help keep pollution in check  and keep their lawns and gardens healthy by adopting <a href="http://www.iisgcp.org/l2l/lawncare.html">natural lawn care practices</a> like leaving grass clippings on the lawn, mowing to 3 inches or  higher, and watering less often but more deeply. These practices build soil  that can store nutrients more effectively, promoting a healthier lawn.
