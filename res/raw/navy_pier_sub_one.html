<title>Along the Pier - The river runs backwards</title>
</head>

For most of its history, the Chicago River sluggishly moved  water from the plains to Lake Michigan. This meant that <a href="iisg://content/10">raw sewage and other  pollutants</a> dumped in the river flowed straight into Chicago&rsquo;s primary  source of drinking water. As the city around the river grew, fear of diseases  spread, and officials decided to permanently reverse the river's flow, sending  its polluted water to the Mississippi River instead. In one of the greatest engineering feats in  American history, the city <a href="iisg://content/6">built</a> a 28-mile-long drainage canal. When a steam  shovel moved the last of the dirt separating the river and the <a href="iisg://content/1">Chicago Sanitary and Ship  Canal</a> on a cold January morning in 1900, the river emptied into the canal  and began pulling water from the lake.

To ensure that water keeps moving  westward, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the Chicago Harbor Lock, which  you can see to the south, in 1938. The lock allows for control of the river's depth and speed. Water levels in the Chicago River have to be kept lower than  the lake to ensure that gravity doesn't pull water back toward Lake Michigan.  Controlling the flow of water also ensures that the city doesn't take more  water from the lake than federal law allows.
