<title>Adler Planetarium - The big picture</title>

The <a href="http://www.adlerplanetarium.org/">Adler Planetarium</a> is the oldest operating planetarium in  the world and the first built in the Western Hemisphere. Completed in 1930, it  is home to numerous educational and interactive exhibits about the solar  system, planetary exploration, and the history of astronomy. With the help of  the Doane Observatory, Chicago residents and tourists can also get an up-close  look at stars, planets, and galaxies trillions of miles away. <br /><br />
  Adler  Planetarium is the place to visit for a close-up view of how <a href="http://www.iiseagrant.org/topic_climate.html">climate change</a> is affecting the planet. Thanks to images beamed down from environmental  satellites, visitors can watch ice caps melt and global temperatures rise in  real time. If you are interested in learning more about these satellites and  seeing first-hand what they are finding, explore NASA's interactive <a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resource_center/13">Sea Level Viewer</a>. You can also keep an eye on day-to-day and historical changes in the Great  Lakes specifically with the help of monitoring stations and <a href="http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/maps/WestGL.shtml">buoys</a> throughout the region.
