<title>Along the Lakeshore Path - The big picture</title>

Standing here, what you see is one of the prettiest  views the Chicago shoreline has to offer. If you travel to the city's southeast  side, you will see remnants of the manufacturing boom of the early 1900s that  allowed the city to become the business and cultural hub that it is today. Numerous state and local <a href="http://www2.illinois.gov/gov/millennium-reserve/Pages/overview.aspx">projects</a> are working to  remove polluted sediment and restore natural habitats in this area. But more  than a century of industry left behind staggering  quantities of <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/638.html">industrial waste</a> that degraded water quality and still pose a threat  to public health.<br /><br />
At the same time, scientists are discovering new chemicals  in Lake Michigan and surrounding waterways, often from everyday household  products like soaps, medications, and <a href="http://lakesideviews.blogspot.com/2013/08/research-mission-brings-back-plenty-of.html">plastics</a>. Many of these contaminants are  in the water in low enough levels that they don't pose an immediate threat to  humans. A growing number of studies, though, are showing that they have  significant impacts on wildlife.
