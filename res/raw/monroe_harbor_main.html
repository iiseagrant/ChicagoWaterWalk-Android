The open spaces, bike and walking paths, and public art that  you see all around you are the result of extensive <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/300022.html">city planning and construction</a>. If you could go back in time to the mid-1800s, you would see a  swampy shoreline that sits almost right against downtown. Fast forward a few  decades and you would find yourself standing near a <a href="iisg://content/9">train yard</a>. Today, all  but 4 miles of the city's 28-mile shoreline is public parkland that has been  carefully positioned and designed to make it easier for people to access and  enjoy the lake.
