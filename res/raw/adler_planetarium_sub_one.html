<a href="http://www.chicagoclimateaction.org/pages/climate_change_and_chicago/5.php">For Chicago</a>, the future looks a lot wetter and hotter than  anything the city has seen in the past. Scientists predict wetter winters and  more extreme weather events like blizzards, heavy rainstorms, and droughts. So the Windy City is <a href="http://www.chicagoclimateaction.org/pages/adaptation/49.php">getting ready</a>. <br /><br />
  Wetter snow and heavier rainfall can overwhelm sewers and  flood a city mostly made of concrete surfaces that can't absorb water. Even  now, sewers frequently overflow during heavy storms and rainwater rushes into  the Chicago River and Lake Michigan, as well as backyards and basements.  Flooding costs the city and its residents millions of dollars a year. And these  costs will rise as the frequency and intensity of rainstorms does too. In  preparation, the city is repaving alleys with permeable surfaces, installing  rooftop gardens on public buildings, and planting more trees and other  vegetation across the city to soak up rainfall.Â  <br /><br />
  Giving Chicago's landscape a makeover will also help during  future droughts. As you might guess, long dry periods can put a serious strain  on water supplies. But dry weather also impacts water quality. Water levels in  rivers and lakes may drop during droughts, but the amount of pollution dumped  into waterways probably won't. If there isn't enough water to dilute  contaminants, lakes and rivers can become toxic, forcing sanitary districts to  use more chemicals and spend more money for the same quality drinking water.  Covering the city with plants and trees that filter out pollutants could help  keep water quality in check even when the supply is low.
