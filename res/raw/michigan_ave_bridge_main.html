</head>

<body>

The view of the Chicago River from the Michigan Avenue Bridge—officially named DuSable  Bridge—is seen by thousands of residents and tourists everyday while travelling between Chicago's busy <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/764.html">Loop</a> and the high-end stores and landmarks of the <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/778.html">Magnificent Mile</a>. The bridge itself, decorated with  scenes from the city's past, is also a National Historic Landmark. <br /><br />
  The bridge  crosses the Main Branch of the Chicago River, which later meets up with the North  Branch near the historic Merchandise Mart to form the river's South Branch.  Altogether, the Chicago River system extends from Lake Michigan into southern  Cook County and is home to more than 70 species of fish, 60 species of birds, beavers, muskrats, snapping turtles, and the occasional river otter.
