You are standing on <a href="http://www.cpdbeaches.com/beaches/12th-street-beach/">12th Street Beach</a>, part of one  of the most striking gems of the Chicago lakefront: <a href="http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks/Northerly-Island/">Northerly Island</a>. Like much  of the <a href="iisg://content/0">downtown lakefront</a>,  the 91-acre peninsula was created from landfill, ash, and dirt in the early  decades of the 1900s. It has played an important role in Chicago history,  particularly for being the site of the <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/225.html">Century of Progress</a>, the 1933-34 World's Fair (pictured here). <br /><br />
  The designers of Northerly Island planned for it to be open  parkland. But, due to the city's growing need for a lakefront airfield that  could handle larger planes, the area was converted to an airport roughly 20  years after it was completed. In 2003, the Merrill C. Meigs Field Airport was  demolished. Since then, the Chicago Park District has launched a series of  renovation projects to return Northerly Island to the parkland it was intended  to be. And they are just some of many on-going efforts to restore and preserve  Chicago-area ecosystems.
