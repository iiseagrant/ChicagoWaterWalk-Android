<title>The Ohio Street Beach - Buoys swim in data</title>
</head>

<body>

Buoys are scientists' eyes on the Great Lakes. <a href="http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/maps/WestGL.shtml">Across the region</a>, these tools are constantly collecting and transmitting data on lake conditions like air and water temperature, wind speeds, wave height and direction, and atmospheric pressure. The real-time data lets researchers see changes in water quality, weather conditions, and much more without ever getting their feet wet. 

<br /><br />

  Buoys in nearshore waters play a particularly important role in understanding how Lake Michigan works. Coastal waters provide food, homes, and spawning grounds for almost every species in the lake. But because research has historically focused on open waters, less is known about the ecology of  shallow waters. <a href="http://www.iisgcp.org/buoy/index.html">Nearshore buoys</a> are helping scientists understand everything from why oxygen and nutrients are more available in shallow waters to how  seasonal changes affect where fish and other aquatic wildlife live. 
  
  <br /><br />
  
  But it is not just scientists who use buoys to keep an eye on the ever-changing lakes. Because most of the data is <a href="http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=cnii2">available to the public</a>, boaters, kayakers, and anglers also use it to determine when it is safe to venture from shore. Anglers can even use information on water temperature to know where to go for their favorite species of fish.
