If you step inside the <a href="http://www.sheddaquarium.org/">Shedd Aquarium</a>, you will get an up-close  look at some of the aquatic animals that are at home in the Great Lakes region,  including lake sturgeons, river otters, and the largest salamander in North  America. You could also visit the Amazon River, Caribbean reefs, Arctic ice  flows, and the open ocean. Altogether, Shedd Aquarium is home to 1,500 species  of fish, mammals, birds, snakes, amphibians, and insects, making it one of the  largest and most diverse aquariums in the world. <br /><br />
  Outside the  aquarium, southern Lake Michigan's biological diversity is getting a boost from  the rocks you can see just offshore. These rocks, known as riprap, are  primarily designed to deflect waves and protect the seawall, but they also  double as a habitat for fish, invertebrates, and even bacteria that prefer  rocky shores.
