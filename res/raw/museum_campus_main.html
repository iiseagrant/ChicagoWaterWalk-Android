<title>Museum Campus - Let's get started</title>

You are at Museum Campus, home to Adler Planetarium, Shedd  Aquarium, and the Field Museum of Natural History. For most of their history,  these museums were divided by Lake Shore Drive. The lanes were moved in 1998 to  make the site more pedestrian-friendly with green spaces, gardens, jogging  paths, and walkways. Spanning 57 acres, Museum Campus attracts millions of  residents and tourists each year, making it one of the most-visited locations  in Chicago. <br /><br />
  Look out into the water and you will see the southernmost  point of the Chicago breakwater, which protects the downtown shoreline from  heavy waves. If you look closely, you will see cracks, rust, and other signs of  deterioration. Much of this is regular wear and tear from constant waves, but the  corrosion has gotten worse in recent decades. Parts of the barrier that should  be underwater have been exposed to air due to Lake Michigan's low water levels.
