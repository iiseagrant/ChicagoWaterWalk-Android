<title>The Viewing Deck - Drinking water - why worry?</title>
</head>

<body>

Lake Michigan is clearly great in size, so it may be hard to  imagine why the region is concerned about having enough water to support its  people and industry. But there are federal limits on how much water Illinois  can take from the lake, and underground aquifers are already being pumped dry. As  a result, the region's water supply is much more limited than it appears. What's  more, demand for water is on the rise as the Chicago area continues to grow.  Experts anticipate that northeast Illinois will need as much as 64 percent more  water by 2050 for its 12 million residents. This thirst will be hard to quench  without careful <a href="http://www.iisgcp.org/water_supply/water2050.html">planning</a> and conservation.      <br /><br />

  To make sure the region is never left high and dry,  officials have started ramping up water conservation efforts. At the top of the  list is the <a href="http://www.iisgcp.org/water_supply/water_rates.html">price of water</a>. Water bills often don't cover all the costs of  pumping, cleaning, and delivering water to homes and businesses. Low prices  leave cities without money to repair aging pipes, many more than 100 years old.  Water economists have recommended that communities charge residents and  businesses what it really costs to bring them water. City officials and  planners have also called on Chicago residents to <a href="http://www.iisgcp.org/water_supply/outdoor_conserv.html">use less water</a> on their lawns. Illinois lawns need only an inch of water a week, or about two hours of  sprinkling. Any more than that can't be absorbed and instead runs off into  nearby lakes and rivers, carrying pollutants with it.
