<a href="http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/data/now/wlevels/levels.html">Water levels</a> in the Great Lakes are on the decline, and lakes Michigan and Huron have  been the hardest hit. Water levels there hit an all-time low in 2013 after 15  years of below-average levels. The story is not quite as severe in the other  lakes, but water levels in each have been below average since 1998. <br /><br />
  The  primary culprit is evaporation. Historically, the lakes were covered with large  sheets of ice during the winter, which slowed down evaporation. Decades of  unusually warm water temperatures, though, have left large portions of the lakes  ice-free. This creates year-long evaporation. At the same time, there has been less  rain, so the lakes are losing water faster than it can be replaced. <br /><br />
  The loss of so much water is taking a toll on the region. Boaters  are finding it harder to navigate harbors. Fish and other aquatic wildlife are  being pushed out of their nearshore habitats. One of the largest impacts is  economic. Industries in the region rely heavily on the Great Lakes to ship bulk  goods like iron, coal, and salt. To safely navigate shallower waters, shipping  companies have had to lighten the loads on their ships and barges by thousands  of tons, making lake travel less efficient and much more expensive.
