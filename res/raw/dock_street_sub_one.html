<title>Dock Street - Why a sea wall?</title>
</head>

<body>

Sea walls like the ones to the south of you are one of many coastal defense techniques. They are used all along the city&rsquo;s downtown  shoreline to protect economic and recreational centers like Michigan Avenue and  Grant Park from heavy summer storms and the natural <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1142.html">ebb and flow</a> of Lake  Michigan. But the most important coastal defense here is the breakwater that  runs parallel to this part of the pier. It is easily overlooked in the dazzle of  Navy Pier, but this rock and timber barrier helped transform a small military  post into the commercial and cultural center it is today. It was built to  shield the Chicago River, the <a href="iisg://content/2">region&rsquo;s busiest harbor</a> in the 19th century, from heavy waves and drifting sand. Without barriers like this,  the river mouth would have filled in with so much sand that shipping vessels  would not have been able to dock in downtown Chicago.

  Coastal defenses are not without their downsides. Both sea  walls and breakwaters require constant, and often costly, maintenance. They  also change the natural movement of water and sand. Artificial shorelines,  especially vertical walls, can&rsquo;t absorb wave energy as well as natural ones,  causing waves to bounce back with more force than they should. These stronger  waves crash against land beyond the protection of the sea wall and rapidly  erode that shoreline. At the same time, breakwaters and sea walls trap sand and  dirt and prevent them from replenishing beaches down shore, exposing finer  lakebed sediments there to waves they cannot withstand.
