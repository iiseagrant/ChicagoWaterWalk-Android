Looking at the shops and crowds of <a href="http://www.navypier.com/about/history.html">Navy Pier</a> today, it may  be hard to imagine that Chicago&rsquo;s number one tourist attraction was built to  revive the city&rsquo;s dwindling downtown shipping industry. The <a href="iisg://content/4">original pier</a>, built in  1916, was filled with commercial warehouses and lined with docks for lake  freighters to load and unload cargo. The 3,000-foot pier proved to be no match,  though, for the bustling harbors of Chicago&rsquo;s southside and Milwaukee.

  Look across the small bay to the south and you will get an up-close  view of the man-made shoreline that stretches across most of the city's border  with Lake Michigan. The sea walls to your right and directly in front of  you—one lined with metal, the other with rocks—serve as a kind of armor for the  shoreline, protecting it from erosion and flooding. Both types of sea walls  reduce the brunt of incoming waves, but the rocks can also double as habitat  for fish, invertebrates, and even bacteria that prefer rocky shores.
