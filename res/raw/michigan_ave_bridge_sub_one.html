<title>The Michigan Avenue Bridge - Bridges, Chicago-style</title>
</head>

<body>

The DuSable  Bridge may look like an ordinary bridge. But it and many others along the river  were specially engineered to make it faster and easier for commercial ships to  carry their goods in and out of the river. Be here at the right time, and you  will see the bridge temporarily raised to make room for large boats and barges  below. Chicago has 38 moveable bridges, now commonly known as <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/166.html">Chicago-style drawbridges</a>. This one is the most celebrated in the city. <br /><br />
  Chicago  engineers experimented with several bridge designs in the 1800s to find one  that would allow boats to easily navigate the river and still safely hold the  weight of heavy traffic. The first moveable bridge was built over Dearborn  Street, but it was soon dismantled. It wasn't until 1902 that engineers  completed the first Chicago-style drawbridge. The design is considered a major  engineering advance and has served as the prototype for most of the bridges in  the Chicago area, including the DuSable Bridge. The original drawbridge, which  spans the river at Cortland Street, is still in use today.
