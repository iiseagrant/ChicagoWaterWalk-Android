<title>The Chicago River Mouth - The big picture</title>
</head>

<body>

The harbor lock at the mouth of the Chicago River is one of many  changes people have made to the river and lake since the early 1800s. Less than  30 years after the region became a part of the United States, soldiers began  removing sandbars near where the lock now stands to make it easier to ship supplies  to <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/477.html">Fort Dearborn</a>. Over the centuries, the river has been expanded,  straightened, linked to nearby waterways, and <a href="iisg://content/1">reversed to flow</a> away  from Lake Michigan. Many of these changes have been recognized as marvels of  civil engineering.
