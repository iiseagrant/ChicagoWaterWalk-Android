<title>Dock Street - Habitats lost</title>
</head>

<body>

All of the land surrounding Navy Pier is man-made. In fact,  everything from about Michigan Avenue to here was <a href="iisg://content/0">created</a> with landfill,  dirt, and ash. New downtown real estate has added miles of parkland and made it  easier for boaters and anglers to access the shore. But it also displaced nearshore  habitats important to the overall health of the lake. In fact, nearly every  aquatic species in Lake Michigan either spends a portion of its life in shallow  water or feeds on species that do. Nearshore habitats like wetlands and beaches  also trap contaminants that might otherwise pollute the lake.

  The city has launched several habitat restoration projects  over the last few decades. Farther out into the lake, an artificial reef is helping boost the populations of fish critical to the Lake Michigan food web,  such as smallmouth bass, yellow perch, and alewife. Trees and plants near the  water&rsquo;s edge and in nearby parks provide much-needed habitats for the millions  of <a href="http://www.ilbirds.com/Environment/BirdMigration/sub/chicago_birding_map.html">migratory birds</a> that pass through Chicago in the spring and fall. One of the  largest reconstruction projects in the city&rsquo;s history broke ground in 2012 at <a href="iisg://content/5">Northerly Island</a>, just  south of Museum Campus. There, the flat land of a former airport is being reshaped  into woodlands, prairies, and wetlands.
