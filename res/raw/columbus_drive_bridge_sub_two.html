<title>The Columbus Drive Bridge - The Deep Tunnel solution</title>
</head>

<body>

Beneath where you are standing now, and all across the city,  is a labyrinth of giant sewer pipes designed to redirect polluted <a href="http://water.epa.gov/action/weatherchannel/stormwater.cfm">stormwater</a>  away from local water ways. The 109 miles of tunnels, some sitting as far as  300 feet underground, are one part of a flood control system known as the <a href="http://www.mwrd.org/irj/portal/anonymous/tarp">Tunnel and Reservoir Plan</a>, or Deep Tunnel Project. When the plan is complete, these  pipes will carry the city's stormwater and sewage overflow to one of three  reservoirs, where the water will be held until it can be treated. The tunnels  are all built, but construction on two of the reservoirs is still underway. The  project is expected to extend to 2029. <br /><br />
  Even uncompleted, the city and its suburbs are already  reaping benefits from the project. The tunnel system can hold 2.3 billion  gallons of overflow that would otherwise have to be discharged into nearby  rivers. And the Majewski Reservoir has saved nearby communities more than $250  million in flood damages. However, Deep Tunnel is not the ultimate stormwater  solution. A more long-term strategy is to prevent rain from flowing into sewers  in the first place by replacing cement and asphalt with trees and plants, which  can absorb rainwater. As the number of <a href="http://www.chicagoclimateaction.org/pages/precipitation/21.php">large storms</a> continues to rise in  Chicago, so does the importance of <a href="http://water.epa.gov/infrastructure/greeninfrastructure/">green infrastructure</a>.
