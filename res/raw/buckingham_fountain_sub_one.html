<title>Buckingham Fountain - Water for a thirsty region</title>
</head>

<body>

It may be hard to imagine why communities  near Lake Michigan are concerned about having enough water to support their  people and industry. But, with federal limits on how much water Illinois can take  from the lake and an ever-growing population, the supply is much more limited  than it appears. The story is the same for suburbs that use deep underground  aquifers for drinking water. There, water is already being pumped out faster  than the aquifer can recharge. 
<br /><br />
Right now,  Chicago and many of its suburbs get their drinking water from Lake Michigan.  The water flows in tunnels from cribs that sit 2 miles out. On a clear day, you  can see one of these pumping stations from here. Together with inland rivers  and aquifers, the lake supplies roughly 1.5 billion gallons of water to houses  and business across the region every day. By 2050, officials expect the  northeastern Illinois population to swell to more than 12 million people. When  that happens, the region will need as much as 64 percent more water than it has  now, a thirst that will be hard to quench without <a href="http://www.iisgcp.org/topic_watersupply.html">careful planning and conservation</a>.
