<title>Northerly Island - Getting back to nature</title>
</head>

If you walk farther south, you will see a long, flat stretch  of grass. Come back in about 20 years and you won't recognize the place. By then, the  flat land that once covered the southern half will have been reshaped into  woodlands, savannahs, and prairies, with wetlands and artificial reefs hugging  the western shore. A little farther north, you will be able to attend plays and  concerts at the new amphitheater, visit the Northerly Island Education Center,  and take a stroll down the harbor boardwalk. Families will also find room for  picnicking and camping throughout the peninsula. <br /><br />
  The plan for the south side of the Northerly Island is to  make the lakefront look more like it did before the city was settled. This will  bring back habitats for millions of migratory birds and other land animals. The  restoration will offer much-needed stopover spots for songbirds, ducks, hawks,  and more as they fly north and south each year. Just off shore, rocks and  underwater vegetation—two things that are scarce along the Chicago  lakefront—will also help native fish species find food, avoid predators, and  reproduce. These projects began in 2012 and are expected to take about five  years—two years for construction and another three years for the new plants and  habitats to take hold.
