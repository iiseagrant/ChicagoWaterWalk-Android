<title>The Columbus Drive Bridge - Did you know?</title>
</head>

<body>

You can't talk about the Chicago River without talking about  pollution. Historically, one of the river's primary roles was to flush waste  out of the city. Part of the <a href="iisg://content/10">South Branch</a>, where stock  yards and <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/804.html">meat packing plants</a> were common in the 1900s, was given the nickname Bubbly  Creek because gases from decomposing waste gurgled up from the riverbed. Even  the famous practice of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSrogdFkNvE">dyeing the river green</a> for St. Patrick's Day has a  pollution connection. Today, vegetable dye is used to color the river in  celebration, but the custom began in 1961 when a plumber used dye to trace the  sources of illegal pollution. <br /><br />
  Storm drains like this one near the Columbus Drive Bridge  are a part of the city's efforts to prevent polluted stormwater and sewage from  flowing into the river and Lake Michigan.
