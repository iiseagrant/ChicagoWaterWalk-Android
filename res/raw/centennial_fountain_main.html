<title>The Centennial Fountain - First, some background</title>

As you walk  along the Chicago River, you will probably see tour boats, sailboats,  paddleboats, and maybe even a group of kayakers enjoying a day on the river. If  you could rewind to the mid-1800s, you would see an even more congested river,  but the boats would look very different. <a href="iisg://content/2">Shipping vessels</a> carrying coal, grain, and lumber  ruled the river then, and factories dominated its banks. As the region's <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/300043.html">most important harbor</a> and the only shipping path between the Great Lakes and the Gulf of  Mexico, the Chicago River helped transform the City of Broad Shoulders into an  economic and cultural hub of the world.<br /><br />
Stick around to  the top of the hour to see the Centennial Fountain across from you shoot an arc  of water over the river. The fountain and its 10-minute water show celebrate  the 100th anniversary of the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District  of Greater Chicago, the agency that reversed the flow of the river in 1900.
