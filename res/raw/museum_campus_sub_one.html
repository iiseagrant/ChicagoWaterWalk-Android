The Chicago breakwater system extends from just north of <a href="http://www.navypier.com/about/about_us.html">Navy Pier</a> to where you are now. Its history is rooted in protecting one of the  region's greatest assetsâ€”<br/><a href="iisg://content/2">shipping  on the Chicago River</a>. In the mid-1800s, rock was placed near the river mouth to  shield against heavy waves and prevent sand from clogging the entrance to the  river. Over more than a century, these structures helped the city become one of  the <a href="http://www.chicagomaritimemuseum.org/categories/commerce-and-trade/">busiest commercial centers</a> in the world. Over time, the breakwater system  was expanded to protect the surrounding shoreline from heavy waves that cause  flooding and erosion, a function it continues to serve. Today, hundreds of  recreational boaters also take advantage of the calm water near downtown to  dock their boats and safely move between the river and the lake. <br /><br />
  The breakwater is not without its downsides. The structures  require constant, and often costly, maintenance. Over the decades, portions of  the breakwater have been entirely rebuilt after the base of the structure  collapsed. Also, by their very design, breakwaters change the natural movement  of water and sediment. Sand building up along the man-made structure helps keep  rivers and harbors open. But this prevents sand from replenishing beaches down  shore.
