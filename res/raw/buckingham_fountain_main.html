<title>Buckingham Fountain - Did you know?</title>
</head>

<body>

You are looking at one of the largest fountains in the world:  Grant Park's <a href="http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks/clarence-f-buckingham-memorial-fountain/">Buckingham Fountain</a>. It was  designed to represent Lake Michigan, with each sea horse symbolizing the four states  that border the lakeâ€”Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. Opened in  1927, Buckingham Fountain holds 1.5 million gallons of water and is the site of  hourly water shows between April and October.<br /><br />
  The fountain is currently undergoing renovations that will  cut water use in half and repair leaky pipes that cost the city thousands of  gallons of much-needed water a week. And, by installing porous pavement and  planting more trees nearby, the city will help prevent stormwater from flowing  into the lake and carrying pollutants with it.
