<title>DuSable Harbor - Let's get started</title>
</head>

<body>

Let's talk numbers. More than 1.6 million residents swim,  fish, or boat along the southern shore of Lake Michigan every year, and harbors  like this are centers of activity. Dusable Harbor is one of <a href="http://www.chicagoharbors.info/harborspage/">10 lakefront marinas</a> operated by the Chicago Park District, making Chicago the home of more  publically-owned marinas than any other city in the world. Named for the city's  first permanent resident, Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, this harbor houses as  many as 420 vessels. <br /><br />
  Illinois' condensed shoreline is the most active in the  Great Lakes region. Here, even low levels of pollution from marinas can have  significant impacts on the lake and the communities that rely on it for  drinking water. And with more than a billion dollars in combined revenue each  year, these marinas play an important role in the economies of local  communities.
