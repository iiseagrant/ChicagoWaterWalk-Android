<title>DuSable Harbor - Get aboard clean boating</title>
</head>

<body>

Although boats along Chicago's lakefront add to the beauty  of the city's summer season, routine marina and boating activities bring with  them metals, chemicals, and other pollutants that threaten the health of the  lake. These can degrade water quality, harm aquatic wildlife, and force beach  closures.    <br /><br />
  To help marina operators and boaters protect water quality  and coastal habitats, Illinois has established a <a href="http://www.dnr.illinois.gov/cmp/Pages/IllinoisCleanMarina.aspx">clean marina program</a>. Marina  operators who join this effort are given 'how to' information to help reduce  negative environmental impacts. Most of the practices are easy and affordable,  like being careful to do boat maintenance without washing debris into the water  and scheduling construction to ensure that nearby habitats are protected. <br /><br />
  Illinois is one of six states in the region—including  Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin—that is protecting the Great  Lakes and local waterways through a clean marina program. The statewide program  was launched in 2013, but many of Chicago's harbors began implementing clean marina practices in 2010 as part of the Clean Chicago Harbors Program.
